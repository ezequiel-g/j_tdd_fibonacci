**IMPORTANT!!!** use the refactor phase to improve your application design and code quality.

# Requirements

Create an application which allows the user to:
1. Request Fibonacci value for a given position.
2. Request Fibonacci values between 2 positions.
3. Request Fibonacci values up to one position.

# Requirements analysis
The application requires to process user input and print the expected values.

2. process user input and print values.
